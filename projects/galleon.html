        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Galleon AI was originally created as a data annotation platform that would leverage a mobile app to source millions of quality human annotators for AI companies. Our MVP won us a hackathon and a few grants totaling just over $50k. We took the project to the UChicago Polsky Build accelerator to continue iterating and working to launch the app. Throughout the program, we learned a lot, and we realized just how hard it is to even get a startup off the ground. Areas of significant learning included customer discovery, product development, product-market fit, operations, team building, early financial modeling, early fundraising, legal, and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through several pivots and iterations, we ended up building a fine-tuned image generation model for real estate professionals to stage empty rooms with virtual furniture. We envisioned this as the first of many apps to be built for the real estate industry, one that is historically slow to innovate and underserved by tech. We decided to transition this to more of a side project, growing out a community of prop-tech builders with cool apps like this one and a newsletter.
        </p>

            While it did turn into what we originally envisioned, Galleon was an incredibly valuable experience in the early stages of entrepreneurship. I expand on many of the experiences below.
